# Job Board Project

## Introduction
This project aims to improve the job board and streamline the connection process between industry partners and candidates interested in data roles. Emphasis is placed on efficient data storage, management, and access. This README provides an overview of the project's current functionalities, future enhancements, and alignment with professional development goals.

## Project Overview
**Job Board Project**  
**Author: Asia Ibrahim**

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal usability across all devices.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Users can filter job listings by city, country, salary, and job type (full-time/part-time).
- **Dynamic Job Detail Pages**: Each job card links to a detailed page with comprehensive information about the position, company, location, and application process.
- **Modern UI**: A clean, professional design that enhances user engagement and readability.

## Current Status
Implemented features include:
- Responsive design for all devices.
- Filtering by city, country, and job type.
- Dynamic job detail pages.
- Search functionality to find jobs based on keywords.

## Key Benefits
Planned enhancements to further improve the job board:
1. **Thorough Cleaning of Job Listing Information**: Addressing issues of repeated information to ensure data accuracy and clarity.
2. **Salary Filtration**: Adding the ability to filter job listings by salary range, helping users find roles that match their financial expectations.
3. **Relational Database Implementation**: Migrating the job data to an SQL relational database to improve data management, support complex queries, and enhance overall performance and scalability of the platform.
4. **Job Summary Using LLM**: Implementing a Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries for each job post, providing users with quick overviews.

### Future Enhancements
The current job board offers significant benefits. Adding these features will enhance it further and provide several strategic benefits:
- **Centralised Job Listing Data**: Consolidates job listings from various industry partners into a single, highly accessible repository, maintaining consistent labeling and filtration.
- **Increased Visibility**: Enhances the visibility of job openings from organisations committed to diversity and inclusion, amplifying their reach and attracting a diverse range of applicants.
- **Streamlined Job Search**: Simplifies the job search process with advanced filtering and detailed job descriptions, saving users time and effort.
