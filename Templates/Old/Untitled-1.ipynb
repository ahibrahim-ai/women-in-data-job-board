      "The Research and Intelligence (R&I) team is responsible for providing a deep understanding of market developments and the outcomes for consumers and citizens in the markets we regulate. We collect the evidence base that underpins Ofcom's decisions and informs Ofcom’s policy work. The team includes industry analysts, market researchers and data specialists. R&I has been growing as we build the evidence base for the new Online Safety regime, and we are investing in variety of data sources and methodological approaches to build an effective picture of online harms and online safety.\n",
      "Our culture is clear - we live by Ofcom’s values: Empowerment, Excellence, Collaboration, Agility and Respect. These define how we work to deliver our purpose, now and in the future.\n",
      " \n",
      "Purpose of the role\n",
      "This is a leadership role within the online hub in the Research & Intelligence team. Working with five other Research & Intelligence Principals, the postholder will help to lead a large team of analysts and researchers dedicated to building an evidence base for online safety regulation.\n",
      "This is a key role in Ofcom’s evidence-led approach to regulation. The successful applicant will design and oversee programmes of work to collect and analyse data from and about the newly regulated online industry. The postholder will lead and support a team of market intelligence experts, as well as working closely with cross-disciplinary colleagues from policy, legal, economics and enforcement teams.\n",
      "The postholder will represent Ofcom externally, including in engagement with regulated services and with third-party data and research experts. Internally, they will represent the Research & Intelligence team in senior-level engagement.\n",
      "Key responsibilities\n",
      "The role will lead key programmes of work in the team:\n",
      "\n",
      "Leadership of the online hub’s work collecting and analysing third-party data to inform a range of our projects, including our evaluation of online safety regulation and monitoring risks in the regulated sectors.\n",
      "Leadership of other key programmes in the online hub, which might include oversight of programmes of work such as the categorisation of regulated services, formal information-gathering from online services, platform transparency reporting and assessing evidence via the online safety triage process.\n",
      "Co-leadership of the online hub’s work to support the new online safety supervision function, which will include the design of new formats and processes for generating insights about the largest and riskiest online services.\n",
      "Working with other principals in the team to set up and design new research projects when required, including setting up project teams, setting direction and supporting projects through governance processes or to publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key leadership responsibilities include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing expertise to colleagues across the organisation on online industry data and research.\n",
      "Working with policy colleagues to identify new projects to fill evidence gaps about the regulated online industry, its constituent businesses and the safety risks that they generate.\n",
      "Being an active contributor to the wider online safety team, including contributing to strategy and planning work for the wider programme.\n",
      "Directing and coordinating the publication of research produced by the team.\n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "As the online safety regime is focused on assessing services’ systems and processes, rather than adjudicating on individual pieces of content, we do not anticipate that colleagues working in this role will be routinely exposed to harmful or distressing online content. At the same time, due to the nature of the harms covered by the online safety regime, some exposure to distressing content or themes may be unavoidable from time to time. We will offer support to colleagues to manage any such exposure, but candidates should be aware of this aspect of the role, alongside the need to ensure the right support is in place for their team.\n",
